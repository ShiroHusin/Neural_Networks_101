# Tensorflow_basics

A classification problem using the famous MNST dataset and comparing it with 3 neural network frameworks by pitting them against each other 
 - Network 1 is a framework written in PyTorch. 
 - Network 2 is a framework written in TensorFlow.  
 - Network 3 is a framework written in SciKit Learn.  
 - With the same exact hyperparameters and layers, the goal of this small project is to learn the fundamentals of neural networks. 

## Work in progress 
Gave up trying to write backpropagation chain rule using numpy, I guess I'm not that smart.
